This is just two convenience functions that are useful for retrieval of plugin options that can be set globally as well as having buffer-specific over-rides.

Example:  I have a global variable called "g:sortOrder" which is set to "a".  In the test.java buffer, I create a buffer variable called "b:sortOrder" which is set to "d".  Now, GetVar( "sortOrder" ) will return "d" when I'm in test.java and "a" everywhere else.  My plugin code doesn't need to actually check for buffer or global variables; I can just call GetVar and be done with it.

Why is this useful?  It mimics the behaviour of options.  For example, :set grepprg? will return the value of 'grepprg'; if a local version has been set (:setlocal grepprg=<something>), it will quietly return that.  Otherwise, it will return the global value.  GetVar allows the same behaviour for variables.

GetVar will take an optional second parameter which will be the default value to return if neither a buffer nor a global variable by the specified name is found (the default default :) is -1).

Example:  GetVar( "userID", "NONE" ) will take either a userID or the string "NONE" if there isn't one.  This can be useful where a script should just use an assumed default if the user hasn't specified an override (global or otherwise).

VarExists simply returns true if any of the scopes used by GetVar exist (in the same order of checking as GetVar).
